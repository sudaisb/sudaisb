ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sudaisb
  
I have extensive experience and expertise in developing IoT products. I specialize in developing Wi-Fi, BLE, LoRa, Cellular, Zigbee, and GPS tracking devices.
In addition, I've developed motor controllers, SPI/I2C/USART devices, Ethernet, CAN, LCD, E-ink, RGB LED Strips and Panels, Camera, Kiosk, and embedded devices as well.
If you want to develop electronic devices from scratch and upgrade the existing products, I can help you design boards and develop firmware.
Finally, you will get the design, firmware code, prototypes and sample products.
The resources will be validated by prototyping so you can manufacture mass products with my design.

Please feel free to contact me if you want to bring your idea to the market.
